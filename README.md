# FFXIV_MBS
Bot for Final Fantasy XIV market-board scalping

This is a script for finding large percentage differences between the two cheapest items listed on the FFXIV marketboard.
In theory this should help find items that are undercut by large margins in order to buy and resell for a nice profit.

Currently, this runs in console with very few features, but I plan on implementing more features such as:
Multi-world price comparisons, sorting, higher sold items appearing first, etc.

As of right now, this bot just prints out all items with a higher than 20% price difference.

Usage:

Clone and run:

```python3 FFXIV_MBS.py```

in the same folder as the other .json files
